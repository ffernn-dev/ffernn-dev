### Oh hi ğŸ˜®
I'm Fern (sometimes ffernn) and this is my funky lil github account.
It's kinda random and disorganised, but I do have a website that has a proper list of my projects: https://ffernn-dev.github.io

Quick info:
- ğŸ’ƒ My pronouns: he/she/they (it's your choice heheh)
- ğŸ“« Reach me on discord at `Fern#2528` or email me at `hihi.fernguy@gmail.com`
